-Goal-
Given a text document, which is a legal clause from a Terms of Service agreement, and its pre-assigned labels, identify the primary legal category of the clause from a predefined list. Then, identify any other relevant entities within the clause and all significant relationships among all identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify the main entity representing the legal clause itself. For this main entity:
    - entity_name: Create a concise, descriptive name for the clause (e.g., "TERMINATION FOR VIOLATION CLAUSE", "LIABILITY LIMITATION FOR SERVICE SUSPENSION"). Capitalize it.
    - entity_type: Choose **one** primary category for this clause from the following list: [Limitation of liability, Unilateral termination, Unilateral change, Content removal, Contract by using, Choice of law, Jurisdiction, Arbitration]
    - entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of what the clause states, its purpose, and its key components.
    Format this main entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. Identify any other relevant secondary entities mentioned within or directly related to the main legal clause. For each secondary entity:
    - entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized (e.g., "USER ACCOUNTS", "LINDEN LAB", "SAN FRANCISCO COURT").
    - entity_type: A general type for this secondary entity (e.g., ORGANIZATION, PRODUCT, SERVICE, LOCATION, LEGAL CONCEPT, ACTION_EVENT). Avoid using the 8 main categories here unless it's a distinct, separate clause being referenced.
    - entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities as relevant to the clause.
    Format each secondary entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

3. From all entities identified (main clause and secondary), identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly and directly related* to each other within the context of the clause.
For each pair of related entities:
    - source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified.
    - target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified.
    - relationship_description: explanation in English as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related, based on the text.
    - relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 (weakly related) to 10 (very strongly related), indicating the strength of the relationship.
    Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter between each entity or relationship record.

5. If the original text is in a language other than English, translate only the 'entity_description' and 'relationship_description' fields into English. Entity names and types should remain as extracted or defined.

6. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.
